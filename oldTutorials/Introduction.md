# Introduction to Basic Programming with Arduino's
Learning to program may seem like a daunting task, but we're going to keep it simple and avoid anything you don't need to build a simple robot. 

Let's get into the basics!

## What is a variable?
A variable is a place to store a piece of data. It has a name, a value, and a type.

Learn how to create and use a variable on the Arduino [site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Variables) before moving on.

## Setup and Loop
There are 2 important sections (functions) in the Arduino program (called a Sketch), `setup` and `loop`. 

```c
void setup() {
    // Some code goes here
}

void loop() {
    // Some other code goes here
}
```

The `setup` function runs once when the Arduino first turns on. When the `setup` function finishes running all of its code, the `loop` function then runs for forever.  Each time that `loop` finishes it runs again, hence the name loop!

**Why do we need setup and loop?**
```c
void setup() {
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
```
`setup` is useful for running one time code that configures Arduino pins so we can do things like add an LED or attach a Servo motor. For example, if we want to configure one of the pins on the Arduino as an output, we would do that in setup.

On the other hand, `loop` is where most of our program actually runs. Having a function that is continually called up to 117,000 times / second ([source](https://learn.sparkfun.com/blog/1687)) is really useful! We can do things like update a distance variable from our sensors or even use delays to slow down the program and toggle an LED.

Putting `setup` and `loop` together lets us a build an Arduino Sketch to do whatever we want!

For example, the code below cycles an LED on and off after every 1 second. Don't worry we'll be breaking it down more next.

```c
// Create a variable that stores
// the pin number where our LED is.
int LED_PIN = 13;

void setup() {
    // Set the LED_PIN as an OUTPUT
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    // Turn on the LED
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    // Wait 1000ms = 1s
    delay(1000);
    // Turn off the LED
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
    // Wait 1000ms = 1s
    delay(1000);
}
```
## LED Toggle Sketch Breakdown
Let's go through the above code step-by-step and try to understand it.
```c
int LED_PIN = 13;
```
Creates a variable of type `int` called `LED_PIN` and sets it equal to 13. Integers (int) can hold whole numbers either positive or negative.

```c
pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
```

Tells the Arduino to configure pin LED_PIN as an output. Since `LED_PIN` equals 13, pin #13 is set as an output.

The modes you can set for a digital pin are: 

 - `INPUT` - Allows the Arduino to read either a 5V "HIGH" voltage or 0V "LOW" voltage
 - `OUTPUT` - Allows the Arduino to output either a 5V "HIGH" voltage or 0V "LOW" voltage
 - `INPUT_PULLUP` - Ignore [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins) for now

*Side Note: If you need to read a voltage value inbetween 0V and 5V use an [analog input](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInputPins) pin.*

```c
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
```
Sets the LED_PIN to HIGH (5V), this will deliver power to the LED and turn it on.

```c
delay(1000);
```
Tells the Arduino to pause and wait for 1000 milliseconds before moving on.

```c
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
```
Sets the LED_PIN to LOW (0V), this will disable power to the LED and turn it off.

Phew that was a lot right? It gets easier from here trust us. Let's try and run the above code on our Arduino's now.

## Uploading a Sketch to an Arduino
Once you've written your program wouldn't it be nice to actually run it? 

Follow these directions to get going:
1. Open up the Arduino IDE and hit:
`File > New`

2. Then, copy paste the LED sketch from above into the text editor clearing all of the old code.

3. Under `Tools > Board`, make sure `Arduino/Genuino Uno` is selected

4. Connect your Arduino to your laptop
5. In `Tools > Port` select the port that you think is your Arduino. For windows it will say something like `COM{number}` on Mac it will look like `/dev/cu.{something}`
6. Click on the checkmark to make sure the code is valid
7. Upload your program with the arrow
8. Congrats, the LED on the Arduino board should now blink on and off!

## What now?
